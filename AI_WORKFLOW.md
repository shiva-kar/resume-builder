# How I Built This Project

This project was built using AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude inside VS Code.

---

## My Approach

Instead of writing every line of code manually, I:

1. **Describe what I need** - Write clear prompts explaining the feature or fix
2. **Let AI generate code** - Get suggestions and code from AI tools
3. **Review and test** - Check if the code works correctly
4. **Fix issues** - Explain problems to AI and iterate until fixed
5. **Learn** - Understand how the generated code works

## Why This Works

I'm a student learning to code. AI helps me:

- Build things faster
- Learn new patterns and libraries
- Debug problems more efficiently
- Work with technologies I'm still learning

---

## What This Is Not

This is **not** about being an AI expert or "prompt engineer". It's simply:

- Using AI as a tool to help build software
- Learning while doing
- Being honest about what I know and don't know
